# Enigma-Dungeon-Generator
An algorithm for generating floor layouts for roguelike dungeon-crawler games.

This GitHub repository is currently under construction.

The algorithm is planned to be implemented first in GML (Gamemaker Language) for use in Gamemaker Studio 2 and Gamemaker Studio 1.4, with the possibility of a C# implementation later.
